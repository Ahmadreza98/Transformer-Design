# Transformer-Design
In this repository, I intend to design the transformer in the electrical machine design course, which is part of the electrical engineering courses in the master's degree.
## Introduction
To design the transformer based on the information provided by the employer, the transformer must be designed, which includes:
1. The primary voltage of the transformer.
2. The secondary of the transformer.
3. Number of transformer phases.
4. Transformer working frequency.

In the design of a transformer, there are variables that, in order to optimize the important parameters and place them in the desired range, we must constantly change the variables to reach our desired results, these variables are:
5. Flow density.
6. "K" coefficient to calculate volts per turns of the transformer.
7. Calculation of volts per turn "Et" of the transformer.
8. "Kw" window space factor of the transformer.
9. The coefficient of the window space factor Cf of the transformer.
10. The current density of the low voltage winding in terms of amperes per square millimeter. 
11. The current density of the high voltage winding in terms of amperes per square millimeter.
12. Average current density of high and low voltage windings to calculate the dimensions of the transformer core.
13. Transformer iron density.
14. Density of transformer winding copper.
15. Insulation thickness of high voltage transformer winding.
16. Insulation thickness of low voltage transformer winding.
17. The ratio of the length of the window to the width of the window of the transformer core.
**Some of the above parameters are implicit and do not need to be changed, so we only discuss variable values.**
